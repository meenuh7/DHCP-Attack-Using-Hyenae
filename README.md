# DHCP-Attack-Using-Hyenae

As part of my hands-on learning in network security, I explored DHCP starvation attacks using the open-source tool Hyenae. This project involved simulating a network attack that floods a DHCP server with fake requests, ultimately exhausting the IP address pool and disrupting client connectivity. This exercise reinforced the importance of network-level protections like DHCP snooping and rate limiting to prevent resource exhaustion attacks.
